## Introduction

Machine learning is a fascinating and rapidly growing field that involves building algorithms and models that can learn from data and make predictions or decisions. This repository is aimed at beginners who want to dive into the world of machine learning. Here, you'll find a collection of beginner-friendly tutorials, code examples, and resources to help you understand the core concepts of machine learning.

## Getting Started

Before you dive into the tutorials and examples in this repository, make sure you have the following prerequisites:

- Basic programming knowledge (preferably in Python).
- Understanding of fundamental mathematical concepts (linear algebra, calculus, probability).
- Python 3.x installed on your system.

> Data Set Information:

This database contains 76 attributes, but all published experiments refer to using a subset of 14 of them. In particular, the Cleveland database is the only one that has been used by ML researchers to 
this date. The "goal" field refers to the presence of heart disease in the patient. It is integer valued from 0 (no presence) to 4. Experiments with the Cleveland database have concentrated on simply attempting to distinguish presence (values 1,2,3,4) from absence (value 0).
